# Micro-reddit

## About
This is the second project from the Ruby on Rails module of the Microverse program. The objective only comprises the implementation of MVC's models to a database, so I was'nt required to perform any front-end development. Associations, migrations and validation helped build the models.

## good practices it looks for
- No spaces before semicolons
- Presence of a single space after a colon
- Presence of a single space after a comma
- Each selector must be in a new line when they are listed in the same rule
